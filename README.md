# Bike Sharing

## Analysis 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that Des Moines, Iowa would be a good place to start a bike sharing program. We created several visualizations based on CitiBike data to show potential investors that this is a viable project. Specifically, we used City Bike data from New York City's City Bike program from August 2018. 

## Results
Our results demonstrate a few key trends in the City Bike data.

![Peak Hours](https://github.com/nicole-tough/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Peak%20Hours.PNG)

- The peak hours of City Bike rides are from 7-9am and 4-7pm. 

![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://github.com/nicole-tough/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20per%20Hour.PNG)

- Peak hours vary depending on the day. Mondays through Fridays, peak hours align with the general peak hours of 7-9am and 4-7pm. However, on the weekends, peak hours stay consistent from 10am-6pm.

![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](https://github.com/nicole-tough/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).PNG)

- Peak hours were consistent among all genders. This can be seen in our heatmap, which shows darker colors during the same peak hours in the female, male, and unknown columns.

![Checkout times for users](https://github.com/nicole-tough/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout%20Times%20for%20Users.PNG)

- Most bike trips last less than 1 hour.

- Users average nearly the same trip length regardless of their gender. 

![Gender Breakdown](https://github.com/nicole-tough/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Gender%20Breakdown.PNG)

- Male users take more rides than female users or users with unknown genders.

- The number of rides is greater for subscribers than for customers. The most dominant demographic measured here is male subscribers.

## Summary
Overall, our visualizations show that male subscribers are riding far more than other demographics of riders. Additionally, our visualizations suggest that subsribers are using the bikes for their commute to work. This is demonstrated by the peak hours shown on Mondays-Fridays. 

Another helpful visualization would be a map that shows the most common routes for scooters. 

A final visualization would be to track where scooters are most commonly left at the end of the day.
